# Hi there 👋 I'm Barry

> Enabling the world’s learners to advance bright ideas ✨ through better design

## About Me

I'm a `dedicated`, `pragmatic` and `light-hearted` UX designer with nearly 15 years of experience building products and services–as contributor and leader–that add value and improve outcomes for businesses *and* users.

I'm happiest when closely collaborating with smart, creative and thoughtful people to find sustainable solutions to complex, worthwhile problems in `science`, `agriculture`, `education`, `energy`, `mobility` and `climate` spaces.

My research and design process goes far beyond the visual to improve human experiences, optimise workflows, drive business growth, and ultimately make life less complex.

My experience includes many years of building and nurturing effective teams, developing strategies, operationalising mature collaborative agile practices, and scaling design systems.
